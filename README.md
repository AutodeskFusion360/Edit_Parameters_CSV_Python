# Edit_Parameters_CSV_Python
Fusion API Add-In that adds a button to the UI that allows you to select a CSV (comma seperated values) file and then edits existing Attributes

## Usage
This Add-In adds a button to the Quick Access Toolbar and the create pulldown menu. When you click the button it will display a file dialog that allows you to select a .csv file. You can use the WB_Fusion_360__Paramerters_Test.csv included in the repository to test. The values in the CSV file need to follow a pattern where the first value is the name of the parameter and the second value is the value for that parameter.
